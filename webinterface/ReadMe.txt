Welcome to the webinterface!

To test your dataset, you have to take the following steps:
1. Open and run the file "Server.ipynb" (keep it open)
2. Next you can open the file "Request.ipynb" and enter the file-link for your testdata and run the Notebook. There you will then immediately see your prediction of your test data!


If you want just to try it out, we have another way: Open the file "Web_Application.ipynb" and run the code.
Then you can open the localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Here you can enter 7 attributes of a property and you will get a prediction.
However, this prediction does not correspond to our best model and is only intended to try out.
Important to know: This code does not work inside docker.
The 7 attributes were selected with the help of feature importance.

Have fun!
